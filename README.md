# unit-4-game

A simple game where the player tries to match the number choosen by the computer by clicking on different jewels.  Each jewel's value is randomly generated and hidden to the player until he/she clicks on it.  When a jewel is clicked, the value of that jewel is added to the player's total number.  If the player's total number goes over the computer's choosen number, the player loses that game.
